<h3>Applied AI and ML with MLOps</h3>

<p>
I work on data pipelines, model reliability, and systems that fail predictably instead of silently.

<p><strong>Current focus:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>messy, real-world data</li>
  <li>reproducible training pipelines</li>
  <li>monitoring and failure modes</li>
</ul>
